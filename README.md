Making a Dating Survey Form

Things to remember whenever I'm coding:
1.Being more uncomfortable with coding even when copying and pasting. But you can make it for you and change many things around. Take control and design it the way you like. Think of it as Myspace or Tumblr again.

2.Please stop adding so many spaces in your code when the computer does the work for you.

3.Please only add one space for each line of code. That's all you need.

4.If you need to copy something then do so but get comfortable with creating something on your own.

5.You can do it. Do not doubt yourself now, you came way too far, you got this. You are loved. You are worthy. You got this.

6.Always believe in yourself, no matter what happens.
